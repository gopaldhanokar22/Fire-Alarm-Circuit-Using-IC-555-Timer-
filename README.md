Fire Alarm Circuit Using IC 555 Timer 

The key component of the circuit is Thermistor, transistor, 555 Timer IC and Buzzer. The thermistor is a variable resistor its resistance change according to the changing of the temperature. It is used to detect the temperature. The transistor works as a switch. It operates by the thermistor output voltage and controls the NE555 timer IC output. The NE555 timer IC works in Astable mode so it produces oscillating output for LED and buzzer. The LED and Buzzer work as an indicator. When the thermistor detects fire then the LED will turn ON and Buzzer makes sounds.
